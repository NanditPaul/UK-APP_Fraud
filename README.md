# UK APP Fraud Case Study — Data Analytics Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes **Authorized Push Payment (APP) fraud** using a synthetic dataset modeled on publicly reported UK fraud patterns.
The purpose is to demonstrate **data cleaning, SQL querying, dashboard development, and insight generation skills** applied to a financial services problem.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Perform **SQL-based data cleaning and validation**.  
- Build **Power BI dashboards** to visualize trends and KPIs.  
- Explore **fraud resolution metrics**, such as reimbursement rates and claim closure times.  
- **Augment financial domain expertise** with data analytics skills:
    -   Ability to ask the right questions
    -   Find deeper insights and
    -   Derive stories from data
      
### 🔑 Key Skills Demonstrated
1. **Analytical Problem-Solving** -- Ability to ask the *right business questions* (e.g., how quickly are fraud claims resolved, which channels are most vulnerable) and translate them into data-driven analysis.  
2. **Insight Generation** -- Going beyond numbers to identify *patterns, risks, and opportunities* that can influence financial decision-making and fraud prevention strategies.  
3. **Data Storytelling** -- Communicating insights clearly with visualizations and narratives, ensuring technical findings connect to *real-world financial outcomes* that matter to stakeholders.  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **BigQuery (SQL)** → Data cleaning, validation, aggregation  
- **Power BI** → Dashboards and visualization  
- **GitHub** → Documentation, scripts, portfolio sharing

## ⚠️ Transparency Statement
UK Transaction level fraud data is hard to find. Financial transaction and fraud records are *highly sensitiive* (privacy, security, competitive risks). 
Regulators (PSR, FCA, UK Finance) typically release aggregated stats, not row-level data (by month, fraud type, bank, etc.). Raw datasets are usually restricted to approved researchers under strict agreements. (e.g. via-application, secure environment).
This dataset is synthetic, transaction-level data created to replicate patterns of UK Authorized Push Payment (APP) fraud as reported by the Payment Systems Regulator (PSR) and UK Finance. 
While the individual transactions are not real, the dataset is structured to enable realistic data cleaning, analysis, and visualization exercises. 
The techniques demonstrated here - SQL transformations, fraud analytics, and dashboard development - can be applied directly to real financial datasets once access is available.
